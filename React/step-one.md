# Flesh Out The App

We’ll use React to build out the app. Facebook has a tool, create-react-app that can scaffold a progressive web app out of the box in less than a minute. If you don’t have it installed, please install and run the command below in your terminal:

create-react-app miniflix
cd miniflix

# Flesh Out The App

We’ll use React to build out the app. Facebook has a tool, `create-react-app` that can scaffold a progressive web app out of the box in less than a minute. If you don’t have it installed, please install and run the command below in your terminal:

```code
create-react-app miniflix
cd miniflix
```

Go ahead and open up`public/index.html`. Pull in bootstrap and add it just after the link to the favicon.

```code
 <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
 ```

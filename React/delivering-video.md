# Delivering Video

Cloudinary's video player is a JavaScript-based HTML5 video player bundled with many valuable customization and integration capabilities. If you use this video player to embed your videos, you'll define the source video or the playlist for your player as part of that process, and the video tags with all relevant video formats and other relevant settings are automatically generated. 

The player is fully integrated with Cloudinary's video delivery and manipulation solution and it takes just a few lines of code to embed a player into your web page.

# Configure Auth Service

Let's configure the authentication service needed to authenticate users in your app. As mentioned in the previous steps, we are employing [Auth0](http://auth0.com). 


Navigate to your `src` directory and create a `utils` folder. In the `utils` folder, create a file, **AuthService.js** and add this [code](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/miniflix/blob/master/src/utils/AuthService.js) to it.

The core purpose of this code lab is not to focus on authentication, so check out how to [handle authentication as explained in this tutorial](https://synd.co/2t8mdj5) to ensure you are right on track.

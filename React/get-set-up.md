# Get setup

This lab requires `React` and `create-react-app`  to build the app. 


### What is React?

React is a UI JavaScript library by Facebook for building efficient user interfaces and Single Page Applications. With React, you can build reusable frontend UI components in your app.

### Install Create-react-app

Facebook has a command line tool, `create-react-app` that can scaffold a progressive web app out of the box in less than a minute. Let's install the `create-react-app` tool globally using npm:

```code
npm install -g create-react-app
```

This will install the `create-react-app` command line tool, which will make it easy to initialize your app with React.

### Provision your app

Run the `create-react-app` command via the command line.

```code
create-react-app miniflix
```

Navigate to the **miniflix** directory via the command line.

```code
cd miniflix
```

# Build a Mini Netflix with Cloudinary

In this lab, we will build a mini clone of Netflix with React and Cloudinary.

Developers are constantly faced with challenges of building complex products every single day. And there are constraints on the time needed to build out the features of these products.

Engineering and Product managers want to beat deadlines for projects daily. CEOs want to roll out new products as fast as possible. Entrepreneurs need their MVPs like yesterday. With this in mind, what should developers do?

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll quickly build out a **Mini Netflix** in 10 minutes. In fact, I think we might build it less time.
